# "Compute-Politik": A Supply-Side AI Forecasting Dashboard

A submission for the Apart Research AI Forecasting Hackathon.

## Core Idea

Most AI forecasting models focus on demand-side factors (e.g., algorithmic progress, scaling laws). We propose a **novel, supply-side model**.

Our project is a visual dashboard that forecasts AI progress by modeling the impact of socio-political and economic events on the two key physical bottlenecks: **compute hardware** and **human talent pipelines**.

**Our core hypothesis**: AI progress cannot outpace its physical supply chain. This tool grounds forecasting in the geopolitical and economic realities of production.

## How to Use the Prototype

The live demo is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) built to demonstrate the methodology and strategic value of this supply-side approach.

### [View the Live Demo](https://cetalabs-forecasting.replit.app/)

1. **Use the sliders on the left** to simulate various socio-political and economic events.
2. **Observe how these inputs dynamically change** the forecasted outputs (e.g., "Projected Talent Pool," "Advanced Packaging Capacity") on the right-hand charts.

The model is intentionally simple, transparent, and scoped to the ASEAN region to prove the concept's tractability for a weekend hackathon.

## Key Features

### üéØ Supply-Side Focus
- Models physical bottlenecks: compute hardware and human talent
- Grounds forecasting in geopolitical and economic realities
- Challenges demand-side-only forecasting approaches

### üìä Interactive Simulation
- Real-time visualization of policy impacts
- Adjustable parameters for socio-political and economic events
- Dynamic forecasting outputs

### üåè ASEAN Regional Scope
- Focused on Southeast Asian supply chain dynamics
- Models talent pipelines in Vietnam and Malaysia
- Tracks advanced packaging capacity growth

### üîÆ Leading Indicators
- Advanced packaging capacity forecasts
- Semiconductor engineer graduation projections
- Supply chain disruption risk assessments

## Use Cases

### For Policymakers
- Simulate impacts of export controls and sanctions
- Evaluate workforce development program effectiveness
- Identify emerging compute supply chain vulnerabilities

### For AI Safety Researchers
- Understand physical constraints on AI capability growth
- Model capability emergence timelines
- Assess geopolitical factors affecting AI development

### For Strategic Analysts
- Track supply chain resilience and concentration
- Forecast regional AI capability development
- Identify high-leverage intervention points

## Methodology

Our model uses simple, transparent formulas to connect policy inputs to capability outputs:

```
New_Engineers = (Base_Rate * Investment_$) + (Policy_Bonus * Time)
```

This approach prioritizes:
- **Transparency** over complexity
- **Interpretability** over black-box accuracy
- **Policy relevance** over technical sophistication

## Project Status

This is an MVP prototype developed for the Apart Research AI Forecasting Hackathon. The scope is intentionally limited to demonstrate the methodology's viability and strategic value.

## Future Directions

Potential expansions include:
- Extending geographic coverage beyond ASEAN
- Incorporating additional supply chain factors
- Integrating real-time data feeds
- Developing more sophisticated uncertainty models

## Contributing

We welcome contributions and feedback from the AI forecasting and policy communities. Areas of particular interest:
- Additional data sources on regional semiconductor capacity
- Refinements to talent pipeline models
- Validation of forecasting assumptions
- Extension to other geographic regions
