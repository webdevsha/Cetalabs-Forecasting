Critical Improvements to WOW the Judges
1. Forecasting Relevance (Currently 5/5 - Make it 6/5)
THE BIG UPGRADE: Add a validation component that retrospectively tests your model.
Concrete Action:

Pick 2-3 historical events (2018-2023) where supply constraints provably affected AI progress
Examples:

2021 chip shortage â†’ delayed H100 deployment â†’ GPT-4 timeline
TSMC Arizona delays â†’ impact on domestic US AI capacity
China's SMIC sanctions â†’ their model development pace


Show your model's sliders would have predicted these impacts
This moves you from "interesting theory" to "validated methodology"

Why This Wins: Judges want to see you're not just making up correlations. Historical validation = credibility = funding potential.
2. Strategic Value (Currently 5/5 - Add Game-Changing Feature)
THE WOW FACTOR: Add a "Policy Scenario Simulator" with 3-5 pre-built scenarios.
Concrete Scenarios to Build:

"Taiwan Strait Crisis"

Toggle on â†’ packaging capacity drops 40% â†’ shows 18-24 month AI capability delay
Display: Which countries benefit? (India, Malaysia surge)


"ASEAN Acceleration"

Vietnam hits 50k engineers + Intel/Samsung double investment
Shows: Timeline to ASEAN becoming 3rd AI hub (after US/China)


"Export Control Tightening"

US adds EUV restrictions to 5 more countries
Shows: Emergence of "compute black markets" in Turkey, UAE


"Talent Drain Reversal"

Malaysia/Vietnam implement "Silicon Valley return packages"
Shows: 5-year trajectory to domestic AI capabilities



Why This Wins: Policymakers think in scenarios. This makes your tool immediately useful to governance folks. It's the difference between a research project and a decision-support tool.
3. Execution Quality (Currently 4/5 - Push to 5/5)
CRITICAL ADDITIONS:
A. Uncertainty Quantification (Make it Rigorous)
Don't just show high/low bounds. Show:

Monte Carlo visualization: Run 1000 simulations, show distribution
Confidence intervals: "We're 80% confident capacity will be between X-Y"
Sensitivity analysis: "Vietnam engineer training is 3x more impactful than Malaysia packaging investment"

B. Data Provenance Dashboard
Create a second tab showing:

Every data point with source link
Date collected
Confidence level (High/Medium/Low)
Update frequency

Why This Wins: Reproducibility is often an afterthought. Making it a feature shows maturity.

ðŸ’Ž The "Unfair Advantage" Moves
1. Make it Cite Real Research
Throughout the dashboard, drop footnotes to real papers:

"Semiconductor supply chains and AI compute" â†’ cite your research
"Talent pipeline constraints" â†’ cite IEEE/SEMI reports
This grounds speculation in scholarship

2. Add a "Surprise Finding"
Every good research project has one. Examples:

"Our model suggests Malaysia could become 4th largest packaging hub by 2028â€”faster than Thailand"
"Talent constraints are 2.3x more binding than hardware constraints"
A non-obvious insight makes you memorable

3. Create a Viral Visualization
One chart should be screenshot-worthy:

"The Great Compute Redistribution (2025-2030)"
Animated Sankey diagram showing compute capacity flowing from Taiwan â†’ ASEAN â†’ World
This becomes your Twitter/demo moment
